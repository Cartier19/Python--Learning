REVISION

* The command line is a textbased interface on your laptop where you can type in commands to perform various tasks 
* Command Line Basics
* The Integrated Development Enviroment(IDE) is a powerful and versatile Enviroment that offers a range of advanced features for writing and running python code
* We also learnt about Notebooks(Jupyter for example)

* Data Types in python
*Boolean type
*Numbers
*Type conversion
*Variables and Variable assignments


Classwork
*How do you perform the addition of two numbers in python?
*How do you perform the Subtraction of two numbers in python?
*How do you perform the multiplication of two numbers in python?
*How do you perform the division of two numbers in python?
*What is type conversion and why is it necessary?

* DATA STRUCTURES
They are advanced data types used to store collection of other data types.
Types include:
List 
Tuple
Dictionary
Set

** List
To get multiple elements from a list, we use the slicing process
The syntax to performing this is list_name[start:end] or list_name[start:end:step]
To check if an element is in a list, use the "in" keyword

** Adding to a list
Three methods of doing this
1. .append(element) adds a single element
2. .extend(element) adds another list to the end of the list
3. .insert(index, value) adds a single element to a specified index

** Removing from a list
Four method of doing this
.remove



** Sorting a list
.sort() to sort in ascending order & .sort(reverse = True)
.sorted(list_a) to sort in ascending order & .sorted(list_a, reverse=True) to sortin descending order
Comparison Operators are operators used in a programming language to compare
